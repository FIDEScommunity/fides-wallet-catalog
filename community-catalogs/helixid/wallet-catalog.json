      "description": "helix id launched in 2020 as a German self-sovereign identity (SSI) mobile wallet solution. It is part of the German innovation competition \"Schaufenster sichere digitale Identitäten\" (Showcase on Secure Digital Identities), which tested open and user-friendly ID ecosystems including projects ID-Ideal. The SSI wallet embodies the decentralized identity principles where users maintain control over their digital credentials and data rather than relying on centralized authorities. helix id includes a payment wallet with crypto as well as commercial bank money token CBMT, a marketplace with business wallet interaction and DLT atomic settlement. Verification with eID, world wide verification partners and ZKP capability for enhanced privacy protection. Age verification for KJM and WalletConnect integration for Transfer of Funds interaction that enables AML protection.",
